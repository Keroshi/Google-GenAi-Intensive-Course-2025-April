In this notebook, you'll learn some techniques for evaluating the output of a language model. As part of the evaluation, you will also use Gemini's structured data capability to produce evaluation results as instances of Python types.\n\nNote: This notebook is more code-heavy than the first Day 1 notebook ([Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/)). This notebook is not a prerequisite for days 2 and beyond, so feel free to skip over it, or come back later in the week. If you have not yet tried the [Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/) notebook, start there first as it introduces the fundamentals for interacting with LLMs.\n\nAlso check out the **bonus whitepaper** on [Evaluating Large Language Models](https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/neurips_evaluation.pdf).\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n",

Let's break down the training process used for Gemini 1.5 Pro, based on the information provided in the document.\n\n**Key Aspects of the Training Process:**\n\n1.  **Model Architecture:**\n    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a **sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) Transformer-based model.** This means it builds upon the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), but incorporates a MoE approach.\n    *   MoE models use a learned routing function to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows the model to have a large total parameter count while keeping the number of parameters activated for any given input constant.\n\n2.  **Training Infrastructure:**\n    *   The model was trained on **multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators**, distributed across multiple datacenters. This indicates a very large-scale, distributed training setup.\n\n3.  **Training Data:**\n    *   The pre-training dataset includes data sourced across many different domains, including web documents and code, and incorporates image, audio, and video content.\n    *   The instruction-tuning phase finetuned Gemini 1.5 Pro on a collection of multimodal data (containing paired instructions and appropriate responses), with further tuning based on human preference data.\n\n4.  **Training Objectives:**\n    *   The model is trained to improve next-token prediction. The negative log-likelihood (NLL) of tokens at different positions in the input sequences from held-out text is recorded. A lower value implies an improved prediction.\n\n5.  **Long-Context Handling:**\n    *   Gemini 1.5 Pro incorporates a series of significant architecture changes that enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe training process for Gemini 1.5 Pro involves a large-scale, distributed training setup using TPUs, a diverse multimodal dataset, and a mixture-of-experts Transformer architecture. The model is trained to improve next-token prediction and is designed to handle extremely long contexts.\n\nLet me know if you would like a deeper dive into any of these aspects!\n"

Take a look at the evaluation `SUMMARY_PROMPT` for some ideas.\n\nTry the following tweaks and see how they positively or negatively change the result:\n* Be specific with the size of the summary,\n* Request specific information,\n* Ask about information that is not in the document,\n* Ask for different degrees of summarisation (such as \"explain like I'm 5\" or \"with full technical depth\")",

There is no single \"best\" model for every situation.\n\nHowever, based on the provided document, here's a summary of the key points about Gemini 1.5 Pro and its position relative to other models:\n\n**Gemini 1.5 Pro's Strengths:**\n\n*   **Extremely Long Context:** Its primary advantage is its ability to handle extremely long contexts (up to 10M tokens), significantly exceeding the context windows of models like Claude 2.1 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k).\n*   **Multimodal Capabilities:** It natively supports multiple modalities (text, audio, video, images) and can interleave them in the same input sequence.\n*   **Strong Recall:** It demonstrates near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities.\n*   **Competitive Performance:** It matches or surpasses Gemini 1.0 Ultra's state-of-the-art performance on a broad set of benchmarks, while requiring less compute to train.\n*   **In-Context Learning:** It exhibits surprising in-context learning capabilities, such as learning to translate a new language (Kalamang) from a single set of linguistic documentation.\n*   **Improved Core Capabilities:** It shows generational improvements over Gemini 1.0 Pro in areas like Math, Science, Reasoning, Multilinguality, Video Understanding, Image Understanding, and Code.\n\n**Gemini 1.5 Pro's Limitations (as indicated in the document):**\n\n*   **Not Perfect:** While it performs well, it's not perfect. For example, it doesn't solve 1H-VideoQA perfectly.\n*   **Potential for Bias:** The document discusses the need to monitor and mitigate potential biases in the model's responses.\n*   **Divergence:** It is susceptible to divergence attacks, although it emits memorized training data less frequently than some other models.\n*   **Refusal Rate:** It has a higher refusal rate for grounded questions, implying that the model struggles to understand when to discuss contextually relevant information.\n\n**Comparison to Other Models (based on the document):**\n\n*   **Gemini 1.0 Ultra:** Gemini 1.5 Pro matches or surpasses Gemini 1.0 Ultra's performance on many benchmarks, while being more efficient.\n*   **Claude 2.1 and GPT-4 Turbo:** Gemini 1.5 Pro significantly outperforms these models in long-context tasks due to its much larger context window.\n*   **Specialized Models (USM, Whisper):** On some specific tasks like speech understanding, specialized models may perform better, but Gemini 1.5 Pro offers a more general-purpose solution.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro is a very powerful LLM, especially when dealing with long-context and multimodal tasks. However, it's not a perfect solution, and other models may be more suitable for specific use cases. The \"best\" LLM depends on the specific requirements of the application.\n\n-----"

You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.\n\nYou will first judge responses individually, following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Then you will give step-by-step explanations for your judgment, compare results to declare the winner based on the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.\n\n# Evaluation\n## Metric Definition\nYou will be assessing question answering quality, which measures the overall quality of the answer to the question in the user prompt.

   "source": "## Challenges\n\n### LLM limitations\n\nLLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n\nOne reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n\n### Improving confidence\n\nOne way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n\n\n## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about evaluation systems, check out [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/enhancing-llm-quality-and-interpretability-with-the-vertex-gen-ai-evaluation-service?e=48754805) focusing on evaluation using Google Cloud's Gen AI Evaluation Service.\n\nAnd be sure to read the **bonus whitepaper** on [Evaluating Large Language Models](https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/neurips_evaluation.pdf).\n\n*- [Mark McD](https://linktr.ee/markmcd)*",
